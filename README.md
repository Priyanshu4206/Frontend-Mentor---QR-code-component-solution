### What I learned

Working with this project made me realize what's the true meaning of learning by working.
While working on this project I learned concepts like :-

-dividing and conquer technique
-Flexbox properties 
-box-shadow's properties

### Continued development

While working with images properties and adjusting the width and height properties of it for being resposive is one part of skill I really need to work upon.
This time I even leaned how to add shadow to a div box and several tweaks we can do to it.
